berserkcanon,WEAPON,"An experimental warhead derived from the remains of the Theta AI Core which infects the target's munition systems with a weakened strain of the Core's corruptive code. An infected target will be incapable of determining friend from foe, firing blindly at the closest ships in range until the code is purged. All non-infected enemies will also turn on the infected target and bring chaos to the battlefield. The Theta Launcher is also specialized to home in on enemy engines, whilst avoiding all other potential impact points and Point Defense threats.","The Theta Launcher is a specialized weapon with two design considerations. The first is an extremely advanced tracking/targeting mechanism which enables it to home in on enemy engines, whilst avoiding all other potential impact points and Point Defense threats.
The second is an experimental warhead derived from the remains of the Theta AI Core which, instead of attempting to destroy the target with kinetic or explosive force, infects a target’s munition systems with a weakened strain of the Core’s corruptive code. An infected target will be incapable of determining friend from foe, firing blindly at the closest ships in range until the code is purged.",,,

planet_yurei,CUSTOM,"Tri-Tachyon took advantage of Yurei’s remote location and barren landscape to create a planet-wide laboratory for covert experiments. Inhabitants are Tri-Tachyon scientists, sworn to secrecy, only able to leave with the occasional supply ship. With no natural resources and minimal methods of escape, Yurei relies on imported goods to maintain any form of life.",,,,
abattoir_station,CUSTOM,"A space station embedded in a debris field orbiting Yurei. Officially, it monitors atmospheric conditions and extraterrestrial activity to provide an early warning system for the planet. According to employee rumors, it actually houses off-the-books experiments designated too dangerous even for Yurei’s hostile environment.",,,,
